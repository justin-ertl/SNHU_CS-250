# SNHU_CS-250

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I’ve learned that user needs aren’t always written in technical language. They usually start out as broad goals (“book a vacation easily,” “see top destinations”), and it’s my job to translate those into clear, testable features. Writing user stories helped me break those needs into small, actionable pieces of work. Each story gave me a better understanding of the why behind the feature, not just the what. That kept me focused on delivering something valuable rather than just writing code for code’s sake.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I’m developing, I try not to think of it as finishing everything perfectly the first time. I usually start with something small that works, then test it and make changes as I go. In CS-250, things like sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives helped me stay on track and see where improvements were needed. Going forward, I plan to keep using backlog refinement and regular feedback since they make it easier to adjust when requirements or priorities shift.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good teammate isn’t just about writing code. It’s about communication and reliability. During our group work in this course, it became clear that projects go a lot smoother when everyone speaks up, listens, and gives feedback. To me, a good teammate is open to change, shares what they know, and helps the group move forward instead of just focusing on their own piece of the project.
